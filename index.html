    <p>To be yourself is to carve yourself out of stone. I like to find ways on how to make things simple, yet intuitive to use.  I also look for opportunities to tell a story on the objects that I create. My design heroes are Dieter Rams, Arne Jacobsen, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Joseph Eichler and Jony Ive.</p>
    <p>I have recently graduated from the Junior Web Development Program at Generation Australia in collaboration with Academy Xi. The program is backed by Verizon, Macquarie Bank and McKinsey & Company, to name a few. The course taught me programming languages like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, use of Git, GitHub and Agile Software Development. I have learned about the practice and importance of behavioural skills and mindsets in software development. The soft skills training is in communication, proactiveness, adaptability, persistence, growth mindset, personal responsibility and future orientation. As a result, I have created a weather web app as a solo project and a task planner web app as a collaborative project. Both projects received accolades from the instructors and students for its beautiful UI design and parts of its UX Design.</p>
    <p>I have a Bachelor's Degree with Honours in Fine Arts at UNSW Art & Design, awarded with Second Class Honours, Division 1. My majors are Photomedia and Jewellery & Object Design.  My course electives allowed me to gain knowledge and understanding of how a designer can use the software as part of the creative practice.  These include Web and Graphic Design, use of Adobe Creative Suite, Generative Design using Processing and 3D Design using FormZ.  I have collaborated with other Design students on a new Vespa design, its printed catalogue and advertising posters and were awarded High Distinction marks. I have participated, engaged and exhibited artworks in galleries around Sydney since 2008. The launch of #SnapSydney in November 2017 saw my photomedia works featured on an article titled "Picturing Fresh Views of the City" on the print and digital version of The Daily Telegraph in Sydney.</p>
    <p>Becoming a web developer was a dream come true. I am very excited to bring my web development, design and collaborative skills to future projects. I also dream of becoming a coach, mentor or educator in Web Development alongside becoming a full-stack developer. My biggest goal is to become a motivational speaker and author at the same time.</p>
    <p>I believe that to realise your potential, you must learn how to give back. If I could help one person learn a skill, then that person can teach two other people, and so on. I want to have a legacy anchored by gratitude and built on continuity with a positive impact on the community. My work ethic is centred around efficiency, honesty and self-development to give back to the community by delivering enriching and meaningful experiences.</p>
